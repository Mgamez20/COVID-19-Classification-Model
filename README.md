# COVID-19 Convolutional Neural Network Model 
School proyect developed during COVID-19 pandemic. 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to detect COVID-19 in thoracic radiological images, trained with 1,800 images related to "COVID-19", "Pneumonia" and "Normal/No Findings". 

By using libraries such as Keras, Matplotlib, and Numpy the model was able to get 0.954 Train Accuracy and 0.970 Test Accuracy throughout 50 epochs.
